# Ping-Pong

This repository contains a Galaga style game implemented purely with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Features
- Keyboard controls (arrow keys for movement and space bar to fire)
- Enemies with varied patterns, including occasional boss fights
- Collectible power-ups for shields, rapid fire and spread shots
- Shooting causes an overheat gauge to fill; overheating disables firing
- Animated star field background and simple explosion effects
- Stage system with increasing difficulty, score tracking and lives
- Optional login to save your progress between sessions

## Running
Open `login.html` in a browser or serve the folder with any static file server.
Logging in stores your current stage using local storage. Playing as a guest does not save progress.
