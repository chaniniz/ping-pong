# Ping-Pong

This repository contains a simple web-based Galaga style game implemented purely with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No server-side code is required.

Features:
- Keyboard controls (arrow keys and space bar).
- Ten stages, each lasting at least three minutes.
- Optional login to save your progress.

## Running

Open `login.html` in your browser or serve the folder with any static file server. When you log in, your stage is saved in your browser's local storage. Playing as a guest does not save progress.
