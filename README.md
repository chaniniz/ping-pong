# Ping-Pong

This repository contains a simple web-based Galaga style game implemented purely with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No server-side code is required.

Features:
- Keyboard controls (arrow keys for movement in four directions and space bar to fire).
- Enemies move with varied patterns and may drop power-ups.
- Shooting causes an overheat gauge to fill; overheating disables firing temporarily.
- Star field background and simple shield/rapid-fire items.
- Ten stages, each lasting at least three minutes.
- Optional login to save your progress.

## Running

Open `login.html` in your browser or serve the folder with any static file server. When you log in, your stage is saved in your browser's local storage. Playing as a guest does not save progress.
